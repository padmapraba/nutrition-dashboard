## Data
- Source: https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/ingredients/
- Preprocessing: Since some of the attributes in the data were in different units we decided to convert all of them to milligrams using python. We also only chose a subset of the data to use in our dashboard for the ease of implementing it.
