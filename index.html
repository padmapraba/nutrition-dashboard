    <h1>Nutrition Dashboard</h1>
    <p>Many people may wonder whether the foods they are eating is healthy or not. The go-to method to obtain an answer to this problem is to google each food item and compare its nutritional values. Thus for this project, we will attempt to tackle this issue by creating a food nutrition dashboard. This dashboard will be a source for individuals to use, specifically for nutritionists, dieticians, and other food enthusiasts to visualize different food items and their nutritional value. </p>

                    Thiamin: "Thiamin (or thiamine) is one of the water-soluble B  It is also known as vitamin B1. Thiamin is naturally present in some foods, added to some food products, and available as a dietary supplement. This vitamin plays a critical role in energy metabolism and, therefore, in the growth, development, and function of cells.",
                    Carbohydrate: "Carbohydrates are one of the three macronutrients in our diet with their main function being to provide energy to the body.

The main biological functions of lipids include storing energy, signaling, and acting as structural components of cell membranes. Measured in grams (g).",
                    "Monosaturated Fats": "Fatty acids that have one double bond in the fatty acid chain with all of the remainder carbon atoms being single-bonded.",
                    "Polysaturated Fats": "Lipids in which the constituent hydrocarbon chain possesses two or more carbon-carbon double bonds. Polyunsaturated fat can be found mostly in nuts, seeds, fish, algae, leafy greens, and krill. 'Unsaturated' refers to the fact that the molecules contain less than the maximum amount of hydrogen",

                    Magnesium: "Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps to maintain normal nerve and muscle function, supports a healthy immune system, keeps the heart beat steady, and helps bones remain strong. It also helps regulate blood glucose levels and aid in the production of energy and protein.",
                    Phosphorus: "Phosphorus is an essential macromineral, included in almost all foods. This mineral is part of all cells, especially cell membranes, and is essential to bone strength, because it's the main structural component of bones and teeth, as calcium phosphate. Phosphorus is also an important element in energy production.",

                    Cholesterol: "Cholesterol enables animal cells to dispense with a cell wall (to protect membrane integrity and cell viability), thereby allowing animal cells to change shape and animals to move (unlike bacteria and plant cells, which are restricted by their cell walls). Since all animal cells manufacture cholesterol, all animal-based foods contain cholesterol in varying amounts.",
                    Fiber: "Dietary fiber or roughage is the indigestible portion of food derived from plants. It has two main components: soluble fiber and insoluble fiber.",
                    "Sugar Total": "Sugar is the generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
